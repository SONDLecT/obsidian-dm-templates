# Dependencies:
* Dataview
* Templater
* Admonition
* (for *locations*) Obsidian Leaflet

# Goals:
Provide aesthetically interesting, consistent structure and templates to assist preparing for a D&D session, campaign or adventure.

# Features:
* Colorful call-out style sections (using the *Admonitions* plugin) that clearly separate out essential information.
* Dataview ready templates - each template comes baked in with dataview annotated fields, allowing for the creation of a usable database as you use these templates.
* Automatic file management/organization using templater
* Dataview Tables - Each template also comes with dataview tables preconfigured that display information such as "Player characters that are part of this adventure" or "Mentions of [this note] in #Session-notes"
* Helpful prompts and work-book style templates, using lessons borrowed from Mike Shea's "Lazy Dungeonmaster" and "How to Be a Great GM" schools of Dungeon Mastering.
